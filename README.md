# Angular Hono SSR Starter

A modern starter template for building Angular applications with server-side rendering (SSR) powered by [Hono](https://hono.dev).

## Features

- **Angular SSR** powered by [Hono](https://hono.dev)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for utility-first styling
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code quality and formatting
- [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org) for commit message consistency
- Ready-to-deploy with [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (via `vercel.json`)

## About this project

This starter is part of the [BuilderKit](https://builderkit.dev) ecosystem â€” A modern Angular Starter Kit for building real applications faster.

Whether you're just exploring server-side rendering with Angular or looking to go beyond with a more flexible setup, this repo gives you a minimal but solid foundation.

Check out [builderkit.dev](https://builderkit.dev) for more tools, components, and resources.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
